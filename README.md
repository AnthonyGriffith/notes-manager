# Notes Manager Website
This is a didactic project made by myself to practice three main things: **HTML**, **CSS** and specially **Javascript**. Also the architecture used in this project is **Model View Controller (MVC)** 
The idea of the website is pretty simple, give the user a website where he can create and manage multiple notes in different categories in a very simple and nice way. The project is divided in three main functionalities:    
  
  
## Categories ##
The main idea here is to not only allow the user to create notes but also to categorize them so they can have a stronger meaning, making it even easier for the user to find any note in case he needs it.

## Notes ##
Here as it can be seen in the image, multiple notes can be added into different categories, saving the date that the note was created and also each note has two options which are to delete the note and to copy to clipboard. All this with a beautiful and simple design.

## Search note bar ##
This allows the user to make a quick search in the category to find one or multiple notes.
